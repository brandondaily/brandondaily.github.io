<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The mission of the Society of St. Barnabas is to equip and encourage Christians across the Pittsburgh region to grow in Holiness through the spiritual life found within the catholic Anglican tradition. Through their Holiness, members of the Society are called to act as public witnesses to the Lordship of Jesus in their families, workplaces, and communities and to serve and strengthen local parishes. The Society of St. Barnabas is a confraternity in the Diocese of Pittsburgh of the Anglican Church of North America.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The Society of St. Barnabas is open to any Christian in the Pittsburgh region who is willing to covenant with the Society to pursue Holiness through the Rule and communal accountability. The Society consists of members and tertiaries. Consistent with the Rule of St. Benedict, members make three promises to the Society namely obedience, stability, and conversion of life. Members promise to keep the Rule of the Society to the best of their abilities (obedience), perpetually and actively participate in the life of the Society given their specific station in life (stability), and always seek to grow in faith, hope, and charity through the gifts of the Church (conversion of life). The Society also welcomes tertiaries who are not full members within the Society but who regularly attend meetings, celebrations, and other events. More information about the Society of St. Barnabas and the Rule can be found in our charter documents located <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandondaily/Societ-of-St-Barnabas/master/St_Barnabas_Communal_Rule.pdf"><span class="s3">here</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
